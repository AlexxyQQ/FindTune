        Whoa, baby
        ArrDee, ArrDee
        
        I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
        If you want me all for yourself, then darling
        You probably should go
        There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
        I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
        Life without me might drive you insane
        
        I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
        If you want me all for yourself, then darling
        You probably should go
        There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
        I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
        Life without me might drive you insane
        
        Nah, babe, I can't make your day
        But I can make your night
        See, I ain't the trustin' type and it's lust, not love
        And she said, "I'm done this time 'cause
        You make love to me like I'm the one
        Then run off and duck my calls for a month
        Make me feel special and then like a mug
        Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts"
        
        Aw, come back, darling why you rantin'?
        Girl, I'm single and I always have been
        Never promised you nothin' but panting
        Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics
        She said, "You don't show me no respect
        And you're only callin' me for the sex"
        At least I call 'cause the rest just all come crawlin'
        
        I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
        If you want me all for yourself, then darling
        You probably should go
        There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
        I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
        Life without me might drive you insane

        I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
        Life without me might drive you insane
        
        Might drive you crazy, psycho
        I'm wavy so I'm sextin' typos
        But you know what I'm on
        Come mine, girl, we can stay up all night 'til the light show (come through)
        She said, "If I'm comin', I'm comin' to talk
        Ain't comin' to cum 'cause I'm done that I'm bored
        Not some little whore who will come anytime that you call
        We ain't cool anymore"
        
        Ah, why you gotta be like that?
        You know you'll miss me and you'll be right back
        And you're not a whore, you shouldn't speak like that
        I'm nothin' but honest, you know how it is
        The life that I live, I don't want a chick, I don't wanna settle
        You know you're my favourite petal but
        
        I don't give girls flowers, I'll give you good wood though
        If you want me all for yourself, then darling
        You probably should go
        There's no way I'ma stand in the rain
        I can still make you say my name, say my name, say my name
        Life without me might drive you insane

        Life without me might drive you insane
        
        I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
        Living without you is driving me insane
        I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
        Those tears you cry, I'll dry them all away, away
